# **Recursion**
### **How Function call works in a launguage?**
- while the function is not finished executing it will remain in stack.
- when a function finishes executing it is removed from stack and the flow of program is over.

 ### **What is recursion?**
 - #### In simple words a function that calls itself.

 ### **Why do we need recursion?**
 - #### It helps us in solving bigger/complex problems in simple way.
 - #### You can convert recursion solutions into iteration(loops) and vice versa.
- #### Space complexity is not constant because of recursion calls. 
- #### Helps us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems.

### **How to understand & approach a problem ?**
1.  Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problems .
2. Write the recurance relation if needed.
3. Draw the recursive tree.
4. About the tree:
   - see the flow of functions,how they are getting in stack.
   - Identify & focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
   - Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen & paper.
   - Use a debugger to see the flow. 
5. See how the values & what type of values(int,string,etc.) are returned  at each step.
6. See where the function call will come out.
7. In the end,you will come out of the main function.
8. ####  **Make sure to return   the result of a function and of the value type.**
