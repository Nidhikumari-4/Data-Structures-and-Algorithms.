# **TREE**
A tree is a non linear data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a root value and sub trees of children with parent node, represented as set of linked nodes.

## **TREE TERMS :-**

1. **Root** – Root is a special node in a tree. The entire tree is referenced through it. It does not have a parent.
2. **Parent Node** – Parent node is an immediate predecessor of a node.
3. **Child Node** – All immediate successors of a node are its children.
4. **Siblings** – Nodes with the same parent are called Siblings.
5. **Leaf** – Last node in the tree. There is no node after this node.
6. **Edge** – Edge is a connection between one node to another. It is a line between two nodes or a node and a leaf.
7. **Path** – Path is a number of successive edges from source node to destination node.

## **TREE PROPERTIES :-**

1. Tree can be termed as a RECURSIVE data structure.
2. In a valid tree for N Nodes we have N-1 Edges/Links
3. **Depth (or LEVEL) of Node** – Depth of a node represents the number of edges from the tree’s root node to the node.
4. **Height of Node** – Height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node & a leaf.
5. **Height of Tree** – Height of tree represents the height of its root node.

## **Types of Trees**
- General Tree
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Spanning Tree
- B-Tree
- B+ Tree
- Heap

## **Applications of Tree Data Structure -**
- Store hierarchical data, like folder structure, organization structure data.
- Binary Search Tree is a tree that allows fast search, insert, delete on a sorted data.
- Heap is a tree data structure which is implemented using arrays and used to implement priority queues.
- B-Tree and B+ Tree are used to implement indexing in databases.
- Used to store router-tables in routers.
- Used by compilers to build syntax trees.
- Used to implement expression parsers and expression solvers.
