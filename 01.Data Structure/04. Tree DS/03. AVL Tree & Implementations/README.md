# **What is Balanced BT ?**

### Binary tree where the difference between the height of left subtree and right subtree **for every node** is not more than k(usually k=1). This difference is called balanced factor. **bf=|height of LST - height of RST|**.

### So for every node **height of LST - height of RST** should be {-1,0,1}.

# **AVL TREE**

### AVL Tree is a self-balancing BST (i.e., basically a BST which remains balanced even though you insert or delete nodes).

## <u> **Ways of Balancing AVL Tree** </u>

### To maintain the balance in AVL Tree(i.e to be AVL tree always) while inserting and deleting, we perform Rotations. Depending on different imbalance cases, we have 4 basic types of rotations â€“

- **LEFT LEFT Imbalance/case - RIGHT Rotation**
- **RIGHT RIGHT Imbalance/case - LEFT Rotation**
- **LEFT RIGHT Imbalance/case - LEFT RIGHT Rotation**
- **RIGHT LEFT Imbalance/case - RIGHT LEFT Rotation**
